The eBay inventory count will be given by the item number, as long as it is identical on both eBay and your web shop (compare at &ldquo;magnalister&rdquo; > &ldquo;eBay&rdquo; > &ldquo;Inventory&rdquo;). The very first synchronisation of this can take up to 24 hours.<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   <br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   For <b>Variations<\/b>, the EAN of the master item is used, if no EAN for the variation is found in the shop database. If there&apos;s no EAN for the master item, and not all the variations have EAN&apos;s, one of the existing EAN&apos;s will be used also for the remaining variations of the item. If you have the &quot;EAN &amp; MPN Synchronisation&quot; AddOn booked, the values are completed also during the &quot;normal&quot; Price- and Stock Synchronization.  <br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   <br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   *In the EAN field you can also enter the ISBN or UPC. magnalister will automatically recognise which identification number you have provided.<br \/><br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   <b>Important<\/b> for osCommerce: Install EAN expansion<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   osCommerce has by default no field for EAN.
